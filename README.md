# Architecture Decision Records

This repository contains a curated set of architecture decisions I’ve made or led in production systems.

The goal is not to document *what* was built, but *why* specific trade-offs were chosen at the time — including context, constraints, and rejected alternatives.

## What lives here
- Decisions that affected system boundaries, ownership, or long-term evolution
- Trade-offs with real cost (organizational, technical, or product)
- Decisions where “there was no perfect answer”

## What does not live here
- Pure refactorings or cleanups
- Framework or tooling preferences without architectural impact
- Hypothetical or academic designs

## How to read these ADRs
Each ADR includes:
- Context and problem framing
- Options considered
- The decision and its consequences
- Signals that would trigger a future re-evaluation

Some decisions aged well. Others didn’t. Both are documented.

## About me
I work primarily on evolving legacy systems toward clearer domain boundaries and explicit platform contracts.

I optimize for:
- Long-term ownership over short-term delivery speed
- Explicit contracts over implicit coupling
- Systems that can evolve without heroic effort

These ADRs reflect that mindset.
